    <h1>Welcome to Tritones</h1>
    <p>
      Founded in 1996, the Tritones are UC San Diego’s premiere vocal ensemble! The term “tritone” refers to that fabulously dissonant musical interval that lends itself as a pun on the name of UCSD’s mascot, King Triton.

      The Tritones sing “a cappella,” that is: without any instrumental help save for our own voices.

      The Tritones represent a diverse microcosm of the UCSD student body, some bringing years of vocal training to the group, others guided solely by raw talent—all united in a passion for singing. In recent years we have hosted annual Fall and Spring Ballroom shows, won the Los Angeles A Cappella Festival, advanced as far as the semi-finals in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella and our members have shared the stage with many renowned performers including Taylor Swift, Far East Movement, and Imogen Heap.
